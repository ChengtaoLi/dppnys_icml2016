Code for our ICML paper "Fast DPP Sampling for Nystr√∂m with Application to Kernel Methods". See gaussdpp_mc.m for usage.

The code is accelerated with Gaussian quadrature computations, proposed in the paper "Gaussian quadrature for matrix inverse forms with applications (ICML'16)". Please cite both papers if you use the code.
